It also expands to accommodate the growing fetus and contracts during childbirth to help deliver the baby.'}, {'number': 5, 'grade': 8, 'strand': 'Living Things and the Environment', 'sub_strand': 'Reproduction in Human Beings', 'bloom_skill': 'Analysing', 'description': 'A group of students in Grade 8 is discussing how to maintain good hygiene during puberty. They argue about whether washing with soap and water daily is enough to stay clean. Analyze the importance of daily hygiene practices during puberty and suggest two additional measures to ensure cleanliness and health.', 'expected_answer': 'Daily hygiene is crucial during puberty to prevent infections and body odor caused by increased sweat and oil production. Additional measures include wearing clean clothes daily and using mild, pH-balanced soaps to avoid skin irritation.'}, {'number': 6, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Scientific Investigation', 'sub_strand': 'Introduction to Integrated Science', 'bloom_skill': 'Evaluating', 'description': 'During a science fair in Nairobi, a student named Akinyi demonstrates how a simple solar oven made from cardboard and aluminum foil can cook food using sunlight.

She notices that the bulb lights up when the circuit is complete but dims when she adds a second bulb in series. Explain why the brightness of the bulbs changes and suggest a way to maintain the same brightness for both bulbs.', 'expected_answer': 'The brightness decreases because the current is shared between the two bulbs in series, reducing the voltage across each. To maintain the same brightness, the bulbs should be connected in parallel, allowing each bulb to receive the full voltage from the battery.'}, {'number': 9, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Force and Energy', 'sub_strand': 'Electrical Energy', 'bloom_skill': 'Creating', 'description': 'Design a simple electrical circuit using a 9V battery, two bulbs, and connecting wires that ensures both bulbs light up with equal brightness. Describe the arrangement of the components in your circuit.', 'expected_answer': 'Connect both bulbs in parallel to the battery, ensuring each bulb has its own separate path for current flow. This way, each bulb receives the full voltage, maintaining equal brightness.'}, {'number': 10, 'grade': 8, 'strand': 'Living Things and the Environment', 'sub_strand': 'The Cell', 'bloom_skill': 'Remembering', 'description': 'What is the function of the cell membrane in both plant and animal cells?', 'expected_answer': 'The cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell, maintaining homeostasis.'}, {'number': 10, 'grade': 8, 'strand': 'Living Things and the Environment', 'sub_strand': 'The Cell', 'bloom_skill': 'Understanding', 'description': 'During a science lesson, Mwangi observed that plant cells have a rigid outer layer while animal cells do not; explain why this difference exists.', 'expected_answer': 'Plant cells have a cell wall made of cellulose for structural support and protection, while animal cells lack this rigid layer to allow flexibility and movement.'}]\n"
