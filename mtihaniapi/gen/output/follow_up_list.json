        "question": "Why is it important for the cell membrane to be selectively permeable, and how does this relate to everyday life?",
        "expected_answer": "The cell membrane's selective permeability allows essential nutrients to enter the cell while keeping harmful substances out, similar to how a security system protects a house by allowing only authorized people to enter.",

        "question": "Explain how the structure of a cell membrane is similar to a school gate and its function.",
        "expected_answer": "Like a school gate that controls who enters and exits the school, the cell membrane regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.",

        "expected_answer": "Blow into a glass of lime water; if it turns cloudy, it indicates the presence of carbon dioxide.",

        "question": "Discuss how the concept of a cell membrane can be related to the packaging of food items in a supermarket.",
        "expected_answer": "Just as a cell membrane protects the cell and controls what enters and exits, food packaging protects the contents and controls exposure to air and contaminants.",
