Sub Strand: Water Hardness

Bloom Skill 1: Remembering
      Q: What are the two main types of water hardness and how do they differ?
      A: The two main types of water hardness are temporary and permanent hardness; temporary hardness is caused by dissolved bicarbonate salts of calcium and magnesium, which can be removed by boiling, while permanent hardness is caused by dissolved sulfates, chlorides, and nitrates of calcium and magnesium, which cannot be removed by boiling.

Bloom Skill 2: Understanding
      Q: During a science fair, Mwangi noticed that water from a nearby spring left white deposits on the kettle after boiling, while rainwater did not; explain why this happens.
      A: The spring water is temporarily hard due to dissolved calcium and magnesium bicarbonates, which decompose into insoluble carbonates when boiled, forming white deposits, whereas rainwater is soft and does not contain these dissolved salts.

Sub Strand: Electrical Energy

Bloom Skill 1: Evaluating
      Q: During a science fair in Nairobi, a student named Akinyi demonstrates a simple circuit using a battery, wires, and a bulb. She notices that the bulb lights up when the circuit is complete but dims when she adds a second bulb in series. Explain why the brightness of the bulbs changes and suggest a way to maintain the same brightness for both bulbs.
      A: The brightness decreases because the current is shared between the two bulbs in series, reducing the voltage across each. To maintain the same brightness, the bulbs should be connected in parallel, allowing each bulb to receive the full voltage from the battery.

Bloom Skill 2: Creating
      Q: Design a simple electrical circuit using a 9V battery, two bulbs, and connecting wires that ensures both bulbs light up with equal brightness. Describe the arrangement of the components in your circuit.
