      Q: Amina noticed that her phone charger gets warm after being plugged in for a while. Explain why it is important to handle electrical appliances like chargers with care.
      A: Handling electrical appliances with care is important to prevent overheating, which can cause damage to the appliance or even start a fire, ensuring safety and prolonging the appliance's lifespan.


Question 5
--------------------
Grade: 8
Strand: Living Things and the Environment
Sub Strand: Reproduction in Human Beings

Bloom Skill 1: Applying
      Q: Amina noticed that her younger brother, who is in Grade 7, is curious about how babies are formed. She decides to explain the process of fertilisation to him using simple terms. How would Amina describe the process of fertilisation and the development of the embryo to her brother?
      A: Amina would explain that fertilisation occurs when a sperm cell from the father joins with an egg cell from the mother, forming a zygote, which then develops into an embryo as it grows and divides.

Bloom Skill 2: Analysing
      Q: During a science class, Mr. Otieno asked his students to discuss why it is important for teenagers to understand the changes that occur during puberty. What are some reasons the students might give for the importance of understanding puberty?
      A: The students might say that understanding puberty helps teenagers manage physical and emotional changes, practice good hygiene, and make informed decisions about their health and relationships.


Question 6
--------------------
Grade: 7
Strand: Scientific Investigation
Sub Strand: Introduction to Integrated Science

Bloom Skill 1: Evaluating
      Q: In a small village in Kenya, Amina notices that the crops in her family's farm grow better when they use compost instead of chemical fertilizers. Evaluate the impact of using compost on the environment and explain why it might be a better choice for sustainable farming.
      A: Using compost improves soil health by adding organic matter, reduces chemical runoff into water sources, and promotes biodiversity, making it a more environmentally friendly and sustainable option.

Bloom Skill 2: Creating
      Q: Imagine you are a scientist tasked with designing a simple experiment to demonstrate the importance of sunlight for plant growth. Create a plan outlining the steps you would take and the materials you would need to conduct this experiment in your school garden.
      A: To demonstrate the importance of sunlight, plant two identical seedlings in separate pots. Place one pot in a sunny area and the other in a dark room. Water both equally and observe their growth over two weeks. Materials needed include pots, soil, water, and seedlings.


Question 7
--------------------
Grade: 9
Strand: Mixtures, Elements and Compounds
Sub Strand: Metals and Alloys

Bloom Skill 1: Remembering
      Q: What are two physical properties of metals that make them useful in constructing buildings?
      A: Metals are strong and malleable, which makes them suitable for constructing buildings.

Bloom Skill 2: Understanding
      Q: Achieng noticed that the iron gate at her home was starting to rust after the rainy season. Explain why rusting occurs and how it can be prevented.
      A: Rusting occurs when iron reacts with oxygen and moisture, forming iron oxide. It can be prevented by painting, galvanizing, or applying oil to the metal surface to block moisture and air.


Question 8
