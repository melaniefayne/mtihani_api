The cell wall provides structure and support, while chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis.'}, {'id': 14, 'question': 'Musa notices that a beaker and a flask are both used to hold liquids. Analyze the differences in their design and typical uses in the laboratory.', 'expected_answer': 'Beakers have a wide mouth and are used for mixing and heating, while flasks have a narrow neck, which makes them suitable for swirling liquids without spilling.'}, {'id': 15, 'question': 'Amina noticed a small fire in the school laboratory caused by a chemical spill.

Analyze this observation and explain how it demonstrates the process of diffusion.', 'expected_answer': 'The spreading of the food coloring in the water is an example of diffusion, where the dye molecules move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until they are evenly distributed throughout the water.'}, {'id': 19, 'question': 'List two safety precautions that should be taken when using a microscope in the laboratory.', 'expected_answer': 'Ensure the microscope is on a stable surface and handle the lenses carefully to avoid scratches or damage.'}, {'id': 20, 'question': 'Zawadi notices that her homemade cabbage indicator turns pink in one solution and green in another; analyze what this indicates about the solutions.', 'expected_answer': 'The pink color indicates the solution is acidic, while the green color indicates the solution is basic.'}, {'id': 21, 'question': 'Brian is evaluating his lifestyle choices to improve his kidney health; what factors should he consider changing, and why?', 'expected_answer': 'Brian should consider reducing salt intake, avoiding excessive alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight to reduce the risk of kidney damage.'}, {'id': 22, 'question': 'What is the main use of magnets in a refrigerator?', 'expected_answer': 'Magnets are used in refrigerators to keep the door closed securely.'}, {'id': 23, 'question': 'Zawadi is learning about cells in her science class. She reads that both plant and animal cells have mitochondria. What is the role of mitochondria in these cells?', 'expected_answer': 'Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration in both plant and animal cells.'}, {'id': 24, 'question': 'Brian wants to design a simple experiment to test the effect of sunlight on plant growth.

Later, she melted some wax to make a candle. Explain why the first change is a chemical change and the second is a physical change.', 'expected_answer': 'The reaction between vinegar and baking soda produces new substances (carbon dioxide gas and water), indicating a chemical change, while melting wax is a physical change because it only changes state from solid to liquid without forming new substances.'}, {'id': 26, 'question': 'State the primary function of the testes in the male reproductive system.', 'expected_answer': 'The primary function of the testes is to produce sperm and secrete testosterone, which is crucial for male reproductive development and fertility.'}, {'id': 27, 'question': 'Design a simple experiment to demonstrate the property of magnetic attraction using household items.', 'expected_answer': 'Place a magnet near various objects like paperclips, coins, and plastic to see which are attracted to the magnet.'}, {'id': 28, 'question': 'Zawadi notices that her friend Musa is experiencing mood swings and physical changes.
