Analyze the possible reasons why this soil might be more effective for plant growth.', 'expected_answer': 'The soil might have better nutrients, improved drainage, or a more suitable pH level for plant growth.'}, {'id': 40, 'question': 'Amina noticed a fire starting in the kitchen due to oil overheating on the stove. What steps should she take to safely extinguish the fire and prevent it from spreading?', 'expected_answer': 'Amina should turn off the stove, cover the pan with a metal lid to smother the fire, and use a Class K fire extinguisher if available.'}, {'id': 41, 'question': 'Musa is feeling self-conscious about his rapid growth and voice changes; how might these changes impact his self-esteem and behavior?', 'expected_answer': 'These changes might lead to increased self-awareness and anxiety, potentially affecting his confidence and social behavior.'}, {'id': 42, 'question': 'Brian uses a solar panel to charge his phone. Explain the energy transformation that occurs in this process.', 'expected_answer': 'Solar energy is transformed into electrical energy by the solar panel, which then charges the phone.'}, {'id': 43, 'question': 'In the school garden, Amina observed that plants wilted during a dry spell but recovered after watering. Apply your understanding of osmosis to explain this observation.', 'expected_answer': 'During a dry spell, water is lost from plant cells, causing them to become flaccid and the plant to wilt. After watering, water enters the cells by osmosis, restoring turgor pressure and making the plant firm again.'}, {'id': 44, 'question': 'Musa is conducting an experiment to measure the mass of a chemical powder. Identify the appropriate laboratory apparatus he should use and explain how he should use it to obtain accurate results.', 'expected_answer': 'Musa should use a digital balance. He should ensure the balance is on a stable surface, tare it before use, and carefully add the powder to a container on the balance to measure its mass accurately.'}, {'id': 45, 'question': 'Amina is reading the label on a bottle of water and notices it lists H2O as an ingredient. Analyze the relationship between the symbols H2O and the elements it represents.', 'expected_answer': 'H2O is a chemical formula representing a compound made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, which are elements.'}, {'id': 46, 'question': 'Amina noticed that her skin becomes dry and itchy during the dry season. Analyze how the structure and function of the skin help in maintaining moisture and suggest ways she can keep her skin healthy.', 'expected_answer': 'The skin has sebaceous glands that produce oil to keep it moisturized. Amina can use moisturizers, drink plenty of water, and avoid harsh soaps to maintain skin health.'}, {'id': 47, 'question': \"Amina noticed that when she presses a thumbtack into a wall, it goes in easily, but when she tries to push the flat end, it doesn't. Explain how the concept of pressure helps understand this observation.\", 'expected_answer': 'The sharp end of the thumbtack has a smaller surface area, which increases the pressure exerted on the wall, making it easier to penetrate, while the flat end has a larger surface area, reducing the pressure and making it harder to push in.'}, {'id': 48, 'question': 'Amina noticed that her younger brother, Musa, has been asking questions about where babies come from. How can Amina explain the process of fertilisation and development of the embryo to Musa in a simple way?', 'expected_answer': \"Amina can explain that fertilisation occurs when a sperm from the father meets an egg from the mother, and together they form a new cell that grows into an embryo, which develops into a baby inside the mother's womb.\"}, {'id': 49, 'question': 'List two common hazards found in a school laboratory.', 'expected_answer': 'Two common hazards in a school laboratory are chemical spills and broken glassware.'}, {'id': 50, 'question': 'Zawadi is conducting an experiment where she combines hydrogen and oxygen to form water. Write a word equation to represent this reaction.', 'expected_answer': 'Hydrogen + Oxygen ‚Üí Water'}, {'id': 51, 'question': 'What is the role of the uterus in the female reproductive system?', 'expected_answer': 'The uterus is responsible for housing and nourishing a fertilized egg until it develops into a fetus and is ready for birth.'}, {'id': 52, 'question': 'Explain how energy transformation occurs when you use a toaster to make toast.', 'expected_answer': \"Electrical energy is transformed into thermal energy, which heats the toaster's elements and toasts the bread.\"}, {'id': 53, 'question': 'In the school garden, Amina noticed that the leaves of some plants were wilting. She learned that cells play a crucial role in maintaining the structure of plants. Explain how the structure of plant cells helps them maintain their shape and prevent wilting.', 'expected_answer': 'Plant cells have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose that provides structural support and helps maintain the shape of the cell, preventing wilting.'}]\n",
