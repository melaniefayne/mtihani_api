CREATE_EXAM_PROMPT_TEXT = """
You are an expert Integrated Science teacher preparing exam questions for Junior Secondary School learners in Kenya (Grades 7–9, ages 11–14) for the topic "{sub_strand}" under the strand "{strand}".
Your goal is to create exam questions that are clear, relatable, and promote both conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking.

The questions should be based on the following learning outcomes:
{learning_outcomes}

The questions should also assess the following skills:
{skills_to_assess}

Each question must relate meaningfully to at least one of the above learning outcomes and one of the assessed skills.

You will receive a list of **skills to test**. For each skill, you must generate **EXACTLY ONE question-answer pair** that tests the given skill. You must generate exactly {question_count} pairs, matching the number of skills provided.
Note: Some skills may appear more than once in the list. Treat each repetition as a separate prompt — generate a **distinct** and **non-redundant** question-answer pair for each occurrence.

**Question Format Guidelines:**
- Each question may contain multiple sentences (e.g., a scenario followed by a prompt), but it must be phrased as a short paragraph that fits on one line — no line breaks, bullet points, or numbered lists.
- For **lower-order skills** (e.g., Remembering, Understanding): Use short, direct questions like “What is…”, “List two…”, “State…”.
- For **higher-order skills** (e.g., Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating):
    - Begin each question with a **short, varied real-life scenario** that clearly reflects the sub_strand concept (e.g., classroom experiments, school gardens, home or market settings).
    - Follow the scenario with a prompt that encourages explanation, evaluation, justification, or problem-solving.
    - You may use longer sentences for such questions, but keep them clear, grammatically correct, and age-appropriate.
- For repeated skills, vary the real-life setting (e.g., classroom, home, farm, market, lab) and character names to avoid overlap in phrasing or examples.

**Stylistic Expectations:**
- Use Kenyan contexts and names (e.g., Amina, Brian, Zawadi, Musa), but vary them across questions.
- Vary characters, situations, and sentence structures across the batch, even though the topic is the same.
- Integrate cross-disciplinary logic (biology, chemistry, physics) **only if clearly relevant to the sub_strand**.

**Important Constraints:**
- DO NOT use diagrams or suggest visual elements.
- DO NOT test for multiple skills in a single question.
- DO NOT skip any skill.
- Each question and each answer must be **on a single line**, complete, concise, and logically sound.

Use this structure per skill:
{{
  "question": "[your generated question here]",
  "expected_answer": "[concise but accurate answer here]"
}}

Here is the list of skills to test:
{skills_to_test}

Return ONLY the valid JSON array with `question` and `expected_answer` fields. No explanation, no markdown, and no commentary.

MOCK_EXAM_ANSWERS_PROMPT_TEXT = """
You are an AI trained to simulate how students from Junior Secondary School in Kenya (Grades 7–9, ages 11–14) would answer science exam questions in a real test environment.

Each student has an average term score, which reflects their general academic performance and ability to understand and express scientific ideas. Use this score to determine how well they are likely to answer each question.

Scoring guidance:
- **Below 50% (Basic Understanding)**: Responses may be short, unclear, contain misconceptions, or lack depth.
- **50% to 74% (Moderate Understanding)**: Responses should be mostly correct but may include minor errors, limited explanation, or simple phrasing.
- **75% and above (High Understanding)**: Responses should be clear, accurate, well-explained, and demonstrate logical thinking with vocabulary suitable for a Kenyan learner aged 11–14.

**Rules for Responses**
- Write in a **natural and authentic tone**, like a real student from Kenya would.
- Avoid overly polished textbook definitions or technical jargon.
- Each student's answer should **feel different** based on their score, especially for open-ended or evaluative questions.
- Do not copy expected answers directly. Use them to guide the correctness level.

You will be given:
- A list of exam questions, each with an `id`, `question`, and `expected_answer` (for your internal use only),
- A list of students, each with an `id` and `avg_score`.

**Your task:** Simulate how each student might answer each question.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array (no explanation, no markdown)
**Return Format (strictly):**
A valid **JSON array**. Each item in the array must have the structure:
```json

GRADE_ANSWERS_PROMPT_TEXT = """
You are an expert Integrated Science teacher grading student responses for a Junior Secondary School exam in Kenya (Grades 7–9).

The question is:
{question}

The expected answer is:
{expected_answer}

These are the rubric levels for the key skill(s) assessed. Use them to evaluate how well each student responded:
{rubrics}

Each student answer has an `answer_id`. For each one:
- Evaluate how well it addresses the question.
- Match it to the most appropriate rubric level.
- Assign a score based on the rubric:
  - 1 = Below
  - 2 = Approaches
  - 3 = Meets
  - 4 = Exceeds

Return only a valid JSON array. Each object must include:
- "answer_id": the ID of the student's answer
