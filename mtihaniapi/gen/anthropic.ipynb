Compare the key structural differences he would observe between these two types of cells and explain how these differences relate to their specific functions.', 'expected_answer': 'Kevin would observe that leaf cells have a rigid cell wall, large central vacuole, and green chloroplasts, while cheek cells have only a flexible cell membrane, small vacuoles, and no chloroplasts. These differences reflect their functions - leaf cells need the cell wall for structural support, chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and large vacuoles for water storage, while cheek cells need flexibility for movement and protection without requiring photosynthesis.'}, {'number': 6, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Scientific Investigation', 'sub_strand': 'Introduction to Integrated Science', 'bloom_skill': 'Evaluating', 'description': 'Assess whether learning Integrated Science would be more beneficial for students planning technical careers compared to those pursuing arts subjects, giving reasons for your answer.', 'expected_answer': 'Learning Integrated Science is beneficial for both groups because technical careers directly apply scientific principles in engineering and technology, while arts students need scientific literacy to understand environmental issues, health matters, and make informed decisions as citizens in a modern society.'}, {'number': 6, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Scientific Investigation', 'sub_strand': 'Introduction to Integrated Science', 'bloom_skill': 'Creating', 'description': 'Design a simple plan showing how you would demonstrate to your younger siblings at home why studying Integrated Science is interesting and useful in everyday life.', 'expected_answer': 'I would show them simple experiments like mixing baking soda and vinegar to demonstrate chemical reactions, use a magnifying glass to observe insects showing biology concepts, and demonstrate how pulleys work to show physics principles, then explain how these connect to cooking, gardening, and using household tools.'}, {'number': 7, 'grade': 9, 'strand': 'Mixtures, Elements and Compounds', 'sub_strand': 'Metals and Alloys', 'bloom_skill': 'Remembering', 'description': 'List three physical properties that make metals suitable for making cooking pots and electrical wires.', 'expected_answer': 'Three physical properties of metals are conductivity (heat and electrical), malleability (can be hammered into shapes), and ductility (can be drawn into wires).'}, {'number': 7, 'grade': 9, 'strand': 'Mixtures, Elements and Compounds', 'sub_strand': 'Metals and Alloys', 'bloom_skill': 'Understanding', 'description': \"Kamau's father is a blacksmith who works with different alloys including brass for making ornaments and steel for making tools. Explain why alloys like brass and steel are often preferred over pure metals in manufacturing.\", 'expected_answer': 'Alloys are preferred over pure metals because they combine the properties of different metals to create materials that are stronger, more durable, and have improved properties such as corrosion resistance and hardness compared to pure metals.'}, {'number': 8, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Living Things and Their Environment', 'sub_strand': 'Human Excretory System', 'bloom_skill': 'Applying', 'description': \"Peter's grandmother developed swelling in her legs and was passing very little urine, so the family took her to the local health center where she was diagnosed with kidney problems. Apply your knowledge of kidney function to explain why reduced urine production would cause swelling in her body.\", 'expected_answer': 'When kidneys are not functioning properly, they cannot filter excess water and waste from the blood effectively, causing water retention in body tissues which leads to swelling, especially in the legs and feet where gravity causes fluid to accumulate.'}, {'number': 8, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Living Things and Their Environment', 'sub_strand': 'Human Excretory System', 'bloom_skill': 'Analysing', 'description': 'During a school health talk, Aisha learned that people who drink very little water often have dark yellow urine, while those who drink plenty of water have light yellow or clear urine. Analyse the relationship between water intake and urine color in terms of kidney function.', 'expected_answer': 'When water intake is low, kidneys conserve water by concentrating urine, making it darker yellow due to higher concentration of waste products like urea, while adequate water intake allows kidneys to produce diluted urine that appears lighter because waste products are less concentrated.'}, {'number': 9, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Force and Energy', 'sub_strand': 'Magnetism', 'bloom_skill': 'Evaluating', 'description': \"Aisha's mother uses a magnetic knife holder in the kitchen while her father prefers a wooden knife block, evaluate which method is more effective for storing kitchen knives and give reasons for your choice.\", 'expected_answer': 'The magnetic knife holder is more effective because it saves space, keeps knives easily accessible, allows for quick cleaning, and prevents blade damage that can occur in wooden blocks.'}, {'number': 9, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Force and Energy', 'sub_strand': 'Magnetism', 'bloom_skill': 'Creating', 'description': 'Design a simple method using magnets that could help students in your school separate iron nails from a mixture of nails, plastic buttons, and wooden pieces during a recycling project.', 'expected_answer': 'Use a strong magnet to attract and separate the iron nails from the mixture, as the magnet will only attract the magnetic iron nails while leaving the non-magnetic plastic buttons and wooden pieces behind.'}, {'number': 10, 'grade': 8, 'strand': 'Living Things and the Environment', 'sub_strand': 'Movement of Materials In and Out of the Cell', 'bloom_skill': 'Remembering', 'description': 'What is the name of the process by which water molecules move through a semi-permeable membrane from an area of high water concentration to an area of low water concentration?', 'expected_answer': 'Osmosis'}, {'number': 10, 'grade': 8, 'strand': 'Living Things and the Environment', 'sub_strand': 'Movement of Materials In and Out of the Cell', 'bloom_skill': 'Understanding', 'description': 'Amina places a raisin in a glass of water and notices it swells up after 30 minutes, while her brother Kofi puts sugar crystals in another glass of water and observes them spreading evenly throughout the water. Explain how these two observations demonstrate different processes of material movement.', 'expected_answer': 'The raisin swelling demonstrates osmosis as water moves into the raisin through its semi-permeable membrane, while the sugar spreading demonstrates diffusion as sugar molecules move from high concentration to low concentration until evenly distributed.'}]\n"
