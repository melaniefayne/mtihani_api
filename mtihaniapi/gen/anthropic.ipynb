Evaluate whether industrial waste discharge upstream is the most likely cause of this change and justify your reasoning.', 'expected_answer': 'Yes, industrial waste discharge upstream is most likely the cause because it explains both the brownish color (chemical pollutants) and foul smell (organic waste decomposition), while the reduced fish population indicates water pollution that affects aquatic life, which is consistent with industrial contamination.'}, {'number': 3, 'grade': 9, 'strand': 'Living Things and Their Environment', 'sub_strand': 'Pollution', 'bloom_skill': 'Creating', 'description': \"Kamau's community is experiencing increased respiratory problems due to smoke from a nearby factory, and the local water source has become contaminated with chemical runoff.

Analyse the journey of both gametes and determine the specific location where fertilisation typically occurs, giving reasons why this location is ideal for the process.', 'expected_answer': 'Fertilisation typically occurs in the fallopian tubes (oviducts), specifically in the ampulla region. This location is ideal because the egg travels from the ovary into the fallopian tube where it can survive for about 24 hours, while sperm can swim up through the cervix, uterus, and into the fallopian tubes where they remain viable for several days, creating the optimal meeting point for successful fertilisation.'}, {'number': 6, 'grade': 7, 'strand': 'Scientific Investigation', 'sub_strand': 'Laboratory Safety', 'bloom_skill': 'Evaluating', 'description': 'During a chemistry practical at Moi Secondary School, Wanjiku noticed that some students were not wearing safety goggles while heating substances, others were eating snacks near chemical bottles, and the fire extinguisher had not been serviced for two years.
